Elevator Control System

Design an object-oriented system to control elevators in a building.
Implement a simplified simulation that processes a sequence of requests.

## Input Format
- Line 1: Three integers N M T (floors, elevators, time steps)
- Next T lines: Requests in format "EXTERNAL floor direction" or "INTERNAL elevator_id destination"

## Output Format
- For each time step, print elevator action in the format shown in examples

## Constraints
- 2 ≤ N ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ M ≤ 10
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- Directions: UP, DOWN
- Simple dispatching: use nearest idle elevator

## Sample Input 1
```
10 2 5
EXTERNAL 3 UP
INTERNAL 0 7
EXTERNAL 5 DOWN
INTERNAL 1 2
EXTERNAL 8 DOWN
```

## Sample Output 1
```
Step 0: Elevator 0 dispatched to floor 3
Step 1: Elevator 0 moving to floor 7
Step 2: Elevator 1 dispatched to floor 5
Step 3: Elevator 1 moving to floor 2
Step 4: Elevator 0 dispatched to floor 8
```

## Sample Input 2
```
5 1 2
EXTERNAL 2 UP
INTERNAL 0 4
```

## Sample Output 2
```
Step 0: Elevator 0 dispatched to floor 2
Step 1: Elevator 0 moving to floor 4
```

## Sample Input 3
```
8 3 3
EXTERNAL 4 UP
EXTERNAL 6 DOWN
INTERNAL 1 3
```

## Sample Output 3
```
Step 0: Elevator 0 dispatched to floor 4
Step 1: Elevator 1 dispatched to floor 6
Step 2: Elevator 1 moving to floor 3
```
