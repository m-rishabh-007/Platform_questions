Bubble Sort Comparison Counter

Implement a comparison counter for two versions of Bubble Sort:

1. **Naive Bubble Sort**: In pass i (0 to n-2), compare adjacent elements from index 0 to (n-2-i).
   - Pass 0: n-1 comparisons
   - Pass 1: n-2 comparisons
   - ...
   - Pass n-2: 1 comparison
   - Total: (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = n*(n-1)/2 comparisons

2. **Optimized Bubble Sort**: Track the index of the last swap in each pass. In the next pass, only compare up to that index (since elements after it are already sorted). Stop when no swaps occur.

Calculate the difference: (Naive comparisons) - (Optimized comparisons).

## Input Format
- First line: Integer n (array length)
- Second line: n space-separated integers

## Output Format
- Single integer: number of comparisons saved

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- -10^6 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
