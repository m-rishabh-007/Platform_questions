Library System Command Processor

Design a library management system that processes a series of commands and returns the output for each command.

## Input Format
Multiple lines of commands, each on a separate line, terminated by "EXIT". Each command is one of:
- ADD BOOK "<title>" "<author>"
- ADD MEMBER "<name>" <id>
- CHECKOUT <member_id> "<title>"
- RETURN "<title>"

## Output Format
Multiple lines, one result per command (excluding EXIT):
- ADD BOOK: Book "<title>" added.
- ADD MEMBER: Member "<name>" registered.
- CHECKOUT: Checkout successful. | Error: Member not found. | Error: Book not found. | Error: Book not available.
- RETURN: Return successful. | Error: Book not in records or was not checked out.

## Rules
- Duplicate books/members: Only register once (no output for duplicates)
- A book can only be checked out by one member at a time
- Checkout validates in order: member exists → book exists → book available

## Constraints
- 1 <= Number of commands <= 200
- 1 <= length of names/titles <= 100
- 1 <= member_id <= 1000
