# Generalized k-nacci Sequence Summation

## Problem Statement
Write a function `sum_k_nacci_sequence` that calculates the sum of the first n+1 terms of a generalized k-nacci sequence. In a k-nacci sequence, each term is the sum of the previous k terms, with the first k terms all equal to 1.

## Input Format
- First line: Integer n (index of last term to include)
- Second line: Integer k (number of previous terms to sum)

## Output Format
- Single integer representing the sum of terms from index 0 to n (inclusive)

## Constraints
- 0 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- 2 ≤ k ≤ 50
