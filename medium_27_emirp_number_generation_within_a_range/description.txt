# Emirp Number Generation within a Range

## Problem Statement
Write a function `find_emirps_in_range` that finds all Emirp numbers up to a given limit. An Emirp is a prime number that produces a different prime number when its decimal digits are reversed. Exclude palindromic primes (numbers that read the same forwards and backwards like 11, 101).

## Input Format
- A single integer representing the upper limit (inclusive)

## Output Format
- Space-separated integers representing all Emirp numbers up to the limit, sorted in ascending order
- If no Emirps exist, output an empty line

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ limit ≤ 10000
