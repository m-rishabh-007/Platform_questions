Simple Chatbot with Predefined Rules

Build a rule-based chatbot that responds based on keyword matching.

Rules:
- Greetings (hello, hi, hey) → "Hi there! How can I help you?"
- Farewell (bye, goodbye, exit) → "Goodbye! Have a great day!"
- Weather (weather, temperature, forecast) → "I'm sorry, I can't check the weather, but it's always nice to go outside!"
- Name (name, who are you) → "I'm a simple chatbot created to assist you."
- Help (help, assist, support) → "I can chat with you! Try asking about the weather or saying hello."
- Default → "I'm not sure I understand. Can you rephrase that?"

Input Format:
- First line: Integer n (number of messages)
- Next n lines: User messages

Output Format:
- For each message, print the chatbot's response

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- Message length: 1 to 200 characters
- Case-insensitive matching
- Match keywords anywhere in message

Example:
Input:
3
hello
what is the weather
bye

Output:
Hi there! How can I help you?
I'm sorry, I can't check the weather, but it's always nice to go outside!
Goodbye! Have a great day!
