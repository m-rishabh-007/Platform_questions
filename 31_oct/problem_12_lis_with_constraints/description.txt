Longest Increasing Subsequence with Constraints

Find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in an array, with additional constraints.

A subsequence is obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) elements without changing the order of remaining elements.

**Constraint:** The difference between consecutive elements in the subsequence must be at most k.

## Input Format
- First line: Two integers n and k
  - n: array size (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000)
  - k: maximum allowed difference (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9)
- Second line: n integers representing the array

## Output Format
- Single integer: length of the longest increasing subsequence satisfying the constraint

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9
- -10^9 ≤ array[i] ≤ 10^9
