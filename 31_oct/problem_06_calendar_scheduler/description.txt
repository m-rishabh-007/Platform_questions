Calendar/Appointment Scheduler CLI

Create a command-line appointment scheduler that allows users to manage appointments. The system should support adding appointments with date/time, listing appointments for a specific date, and deleting appointments.

Supported operations:
- **ADD**: Add a new appointment with description, date, and time
- **LIST**: Show all appointments for a specific date
- **DELETE**: Remove an appointment by ID

## Input Format
- First line: An integer `n` representing the number of operations
- Next `n` lines: Each line contains an operation:
  - `ADD YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM description` - Add appointment
  - `LIST YYYY-MM-DD` - List appointments for date
  - `DELETE appointment_id` - Delete appointment

## Output Format
- **ADD**: `Added appointment #X: description at YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`
- **LIST**: 
  - Each appointment: `X. HH:MM - description`
  - If none: `No appointments for YYYY-MM-DD`
- **DELETE**: `Deleted appointment #X`
  - If not found: `Appointment #X not found`

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 (operations)
- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD
- Time format: HH:MM (24-hour)
- Description: 1 to 100 characters
