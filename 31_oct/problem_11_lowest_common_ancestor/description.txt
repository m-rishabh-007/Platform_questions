Lowest Common Ancestor in Binary Tree

Given a binary tree and two nodes p and q, find their lowest common ancestor (LCA).

The LCA of two nodes p and q is defined as the lowest node in the tree that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

## Input Format
- First line: Integer n (number of nodes in tree, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000)
- Next n lines: Each contains three integers: node_id parent_id value
  - node_id: ID of the current node (0 to n-1)
  - parent_id: ID of parent node (-1 for root)
  - value: node value
- Last line: Two integers p and q (node values to find LCA for)

## Output Format
- Single integer: the value of the LCA node

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- All node values are unique
- -10^9 ≤ value ≤ 10^9
- p and q will always exist in the tree
- p ≠ q
