Connected Components in Undirected Graph

Given an undirected graph with n nodes and m edges, find the number of connected components.

A connected component is a maximal set of nodes where every pair of nodes is connected by some path.

## Input Format
- First line: Two integers n and m (number of nodes and edges)
- Next m lines: Each contains two integers u and v representing an edge between nodes u and v
- Nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1

## Output Format
- Single integer: the number of connected components in the graph

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- 0 ≤ m ≤ 5000
- 0 ≤ u, v < n
- No self-loops (u ≠ v)
- No duplicate edges
