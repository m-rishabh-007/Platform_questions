Maximum Product of Subsequences With an Alternating Sum Equal to K

Find a non-empty subsequence of nums that:
- Has an alternating sum equal to k
- Maximizes the product of all its numbers without exceeding limit

Return the product. If no subsequence satisfies requirements, return -1.

The alternating sum of a 0-indexed array is the sum of elements at even indices 
minus the sum of elements at odd indices.

Input Format:
- Array nums of integers
- Integer k (target alternating sum)
- Integer limit (maximum product)

Output Format:
- Integer: maximum product within limit, or -1 if impossible

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 150
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 12
- -10^5 <= k <= 10^5
- 1 <= limit <= 5000

Sample Input 1:
3 2 10
1 2 3

Sample Output 1:
6

Sample Input 2:
3 -5 12
0 2 3

Sample Output 2:
-1

Sample Input 3:
4 0 9
2 2 3 3

Sample Output 3:
9
