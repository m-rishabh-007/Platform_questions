Evacuate to Moon

Charge N cars before sending them to space. Each car has energy capacity A[i] Watt-hours.
There are M power outlets, each providing power B[j] Watt.

Find maximum total energy stored in all cars after H hours.

Rules:
- An outlet can charge at most one car
- A car can be charged by at most one outlet
- Energy = Power × Time
- Outlet cannot switch cars even after fully charging

Input Format:
- First line: T (number of test cases)
- For each test case:
  - Line 1: N M H (cars, outlets, hours)
  - Line 2: N integers (energy capacities)
  - Line 3: M integers (power outputs)

Output Format:
- For each test case: maximum total energy (Watt-hours)

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ N, M, H, A[i], B[j] ≤ 10^5
- Sum of N over all test cases ≤ 10^5
- Sum of M over all test cases ≤ 10^5

Example:
Input:
3
1 2 2
100
20 40
2 1 2
10 20
11
3 2 1
30 30 30
40 20

Output:
80
20
50
