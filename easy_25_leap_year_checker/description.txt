# Leap Year Checker

## Problem Statement
Write a function `isLeapYear` that takes a year and returns True if it is a leap year, and False otherwise. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400.

## Input Format
- A single integer representing the year

## Output Format
- Print "True" if it's a leap year, "False" otherwise

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ year ≤ 9999

## Sample Input 1
```
2000
```

## Sample Output 1
```
True
```

## Sample Input 2
```
1900
```

## Sample Output 2
```
False
```

## Sample Input 3
```
2024
```

## Sample Output 3
```
True
```

## Sample Input 4
```
2023
```

## Sample Output 4
```
False
```

## Sample Input 5
```
2400
```

## Sample Output 5
```
True
```

## Concepts Tested
Complex conditional logic (nested if or logical operators AND/OR), modulo operator.
