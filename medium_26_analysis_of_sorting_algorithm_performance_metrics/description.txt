# Analysis of Sorting Algorithm Performance Metrics

## Problem Statement
Write a function `analyze_sort_performance` that compares naive vs optimized bubble sort. Naive bubble sort always does n-1 passes. Optimized bubble sort stops early when no swaps occur in a pass. Return how many passes the optimized version saves compared to naive.

## Input Format
- First line: Integer n (array size)
- Second line: n space-separated integers representing the array elements

## Output Format
- Two space-separated integers: passes_saved additional_comparisons
- passes_saved: (naive_passes - optimized_passes)
- additional_comparisons: always 0 for this problem

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ array elements ≤ 10000
